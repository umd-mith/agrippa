This repository contains the text of William Gibson's poem [Agrippa (A Book of the Dead)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_(A_Book_of_the_Dead)). It is being used for demonstration purposes to teach digital humanists about Git and GitHub.

**Beware** the text has been changed! This is no longer the canonical text of Agrippa. Perhaps it never was :)
